# JD IDE

Desktop editor for Jade Dynasty (Zhu Xian) data files, built with Tauri 2
(Rust backend, React + TypeScript UI).

Milestone 1: read-only browsing of `elements.data`.

## How a file is read

1. **Layout.** Every built-in layout for the file's version is tried. A
   layout's marker table says where the checksum, exporter and tag blocks sit
   between lists. The file must fit it exactly, ending in the NPC dialog block
   at EOF. If several fit (server builds that diverged under one version
   number), the one whose record sizes match best wins.
2. **Other marker tables.** For unknown versions, the marker tables of other
   versions are tried, nearest first.
3. **Detection.** As a last resort, segments are recognised by content.
   This cannot tell a raw checksum slot from an empty list (v165 has one before
   list 296), which is why marker tables come first.

Each list then gets a definition:

| Fit | Meaning |
|---|---|
| Exact | the file's own layout, same record size |
| Partial | the file's own layout, records are larger (tail shown as unknown) |
| Borrowed | another version's definition, same record size |
| Grown | another version's smaller struct, paired by position between matches |
| Name only / Unknown | raw int32 view |

Borrowing aligns record sizes (a longest common subsequence within each
marker group), so lists inserted mid-way do not shift every later name.
Fields with enums/masks show their labels; fields that hold another list's IDs
link to that record (Alt+← goes back).

## Built-in layouts (`src-tauri/formats`)

| Layout | Lists | Source | Checked against |
|---|---|---|---|
| v66 | 89 | marker table only | 1559/1792 `c01/elements.data` |
| v112 | 107 | Jade Editor names, 4 typed lists | JadeEditorFOX test file |
| v156 | 193 | server sources (`zx_source`), all typed | zxserver, Desktop copy |
| v156-signin | 194 | server sources (`JD1447`), extra `SIGN_IN_CONFIG` | none (no file) |
| v158 | 230 | Laravel jdide, 8 typed | 1559 server |
| v160 | 246 | Laravel jdide, 177 typed | Clean/1601 server, ForsakenJD client |
| v165 | 318 | Laravel jdide, 186 typed | 1792 server, Elite JD client |
| v176 | 294+ | Laravel jdide, 211 typed | none (list count unverified) |

Each layout is a folder, `layouts/<id>/`:

```
layouts/v165/
  layout.json     { id, version, source, markers: [{ before, kind }], listCount }
  list_0.json     the definition of list 0
  list_222.json   …one file per defined list (missing = not defined)
```

At startup only `layout.json` and each list's name, struct and size are read. A list's fields
are parsed the first time it is used. `enums.json` holds the shared value and bit-flag sets.
Each list definition is `{ name, struct, size, fields }`, and fields are `{ name, off, t, c?, e?, display?, refs?, g?, when? }`.
Here `t` is a type tree (scalars, `wstr`/`str`/`bytes`, nested `array` and `struct`), and
`refs` names the target lists by struct, so a definition can be shared between versions.
`when` holds conditional types, e.g.
`[{ "field": "type", "in": [7, 8], "t": { "k": "f32" } }]`. The first rule whose sibling field
holds one of the values (or none of them, with `"not": true`) decides the type. The type must keep the
field size. Otherwise `t` applies.
An optional `g` puts consecutive fields into a named, collapsible display group
(collapsed by default). It never changes field names or offsets.

The schema editor (top bar, far right) saves each list you edit as
`%APPDATA%\com.jdide.app\layouts\<id>\list_<n>.json`. That file overrides that one list of
the built-in layout, and every other list keeps coming from the built-in layout. For a
version with no built-in layout, the editor also writes `<id>\layout.json` with the file's
marker table. "Revert to built-in" deletes the list's file.

## Development

Prerequisites: Node 20+, Rust (stable, MSVC toolchain), WebView2.

```powershell
npm install
npm run tauri dev
```

Build an installer:

```powershell
npm run tauri build
```

Rust tests parse real files from `E:/` (override with the `JDIDE_SAMPLES`
environment variable). They skip any sample they cannot find.

```powershell
cd src-tauri
cargo test
```

## Regenerating layouts

Order matters: generate the source layouts first, then import the Laravel
structures. The import merges their enum/mask/ref hints into the source layouts.

```powershell
node tools/gen-elements-schema.mjs "E:/Game Dev/JD/zx_source/zgame/gs/template" v156 "E:/Game Dev/JD/zxserver/zgame/gs/config/elements.data"
node tools/gen-elements-schema.mjs "<extracted JD1447>/zgame/gs/template" v156-signin
node tools/import-jade-editor-profile.mjs "E:/Game Dev/JD/Tools/JadeEditorFOX/JadeEditorPython/formats/elements"
node tools/import-laravel-structures.mjs "C:/Users/mitko/Herd/jdide/resources/structures/elements" src-tauri/formats "E:/Game Dev/JD/1559/gamed/config/elements.data" "E:/Games/ForsakenJD/element/data/elements.data" "E:/Game Dev/JD/1792/gamed/config/elements.data"
```

Then apply the conditional types from `tools/type-rules.json` (e.g. addon `param1` is a float for
rate-like addon types):

```powershell
node tools/apply-type-rules.mjs
```

Check how every layout of a file's version fits it:

```powershell
node tools/check-layouts.mjs <elements.data> [...]
```

The whole `src-tauri/formats` folder is embedded at build time, so a new layout folder
needs no code change.
